# opener

opener: >
  The city spreads out before you. Rushing from point to point, lit by the slow
  strobe of fluorescent buses in dark streets. Stumbling into situations for a
  stranger's signature. Fleeing unknown pursuers, breathing hard, admiring the
  landscape and the multitude of worlds hidden in it. For one night, drop your
  relations, your work and leisure activities, and all your usual motives for
  movement and action, and let yourself be drawn by the attractions of the
  chase and the encounters you find there.

game.heading: The Game
game.abstract: >
  Journey to the End of the Night is a free street game of epic proportion run
  by hard-working volunteers in cities around the world from Budapest to
  Los Angeles.
game.organization: >
  It is a collaborative and voluntary effort by everyone, from the organizers
  to the agents, to you as a player and voice that spreads the word to your
  friends! Let's do this again, Vienna!

# gist/task

task.heading: The Task
task.text: >
  A pursuit across the city in multiple parts: Try to make it through a series
  of checkpoints as quickly and as stealthily as possible, while avoiding being
  caught by chasers. Should you be captured, you become a chaser yourself and
  have to pursue your former friends and allies. No skates, no bikes, no cars â€”
  just your feet and public transport.
